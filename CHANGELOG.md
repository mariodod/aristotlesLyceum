## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-12

### Added

- **M0: the repository.** Toolchain, CI, Pages deployment, and `AGENTS.md`.
- **Dialogue runtime.** A typed script interpreter with labelled steps,
  choices, jumps, codex unlocks, stats and flags. Pure TypeScript, fully
  unit tested.
- **Dialogue box.** Typewriter reveal, name plate, speaker highlighting, and a
  heart-cursed choice menu.
- **Art pipeline.** A dependency-free pixel canvas and PNG encoder, a
  generated 5x7 bitmap font with Latin-1 accents, authored character sprites,
  and dithered backdrops for the bedroom and the Lyceum.
- **Content linter.** `npm run content:check` validates every script, codex
  reference and source list, and reports every problem at once.
- **Act I — The Desk.** The opening chapter, playable end to end.
- **Dream Journal.** A codex screen listing the ideas unlocked so far.
- **Save service.** Progress, unlocked codex entries and stats, with a
  corrupted or unavailable store degrading gracefully.
- **Verification.** 45 unit tests, 7 browser tests, and a screenshot harness
  for visual review.
